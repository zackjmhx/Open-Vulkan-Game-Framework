# Open-Vulkan-Game-Framework

OVGF is meant, for now, to be a Vulkan based rapid prototyping tool to assist in game development.

Once the framework is sufficient as such a tool, then development will shift focus to being suitable for release products.

The goal is to eventually build this Framework out into a proper engine. Hopefully we can get rid of some of the drudgery without sacrificing the power.
